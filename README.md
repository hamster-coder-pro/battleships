# Battleships

## Task

The program should create a 10x10 grid, and place several ships on the grid at random with the following sizes:

1x Battleship (5 squares)

2x Destroyers (4 squares)

The player enters or selects coordinates of the form “A5”, where “A” is the column and “5” is the row, to specify a square to target. Shots result in hits, misses or sinks. The game ends when all ships are sunk.

## Gameplay

There are two game modes implemented "Easy" and "Hard"
In easy mode (type "easy") you can see all battleships on the battlefield - nice chance to test mechanics
In hard mode (type "hard") - battleships are hidden
To shoot - enter coodinates e.g. A1 or J10 or E5 and etc...
To give up - type "quit"
To exit the game (close application) - type "exit"
